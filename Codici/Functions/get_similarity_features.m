function [QRS_similarity, R_similarity, HighBeats_similarity, SQindex] = get_similarity_features(ecg, fs, Rpeak_index)

% This function calculates the Similarity Features: Similarity index between beats

% OUTPUT

% [ ] - Similarity index of QRS (QRS_similarity)
% [ ] - Similarity index of R amplitude (R_similarity)
% [ ] - Ratio of high similarity beats (HighBeats_similarity)
% [ ] - Signal Qualify index (SQindex)
