## Data Bootstrapping

Means to create another dataset out of the main one, randomly selecting some samples from it (can also include repetition of the same sample).

# Bagging

_**B-** **agg**-ing_ comes from:
 - **B**ootstrapping the data 
and
 - **agg**regating the results from different models trained with the datasets obtained through bootstrapping.
