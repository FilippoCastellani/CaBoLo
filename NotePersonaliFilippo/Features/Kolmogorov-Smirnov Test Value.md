The K–S test assesses whether two distributions are different from each other by **measuring the maximum value of the absolute difference (D) between two cumulative probability distributions**.

Example of cumulative probability distributions of the standard AF distribution compares with a distribution of test data. 
Cumulative probability distribution is derived from $RR[i]/RR[i–1]$ and D is the greatest distance between two distributions

${\it prob} = Q_{{\rm KS}} (\lambda) = 2\sum\limits_{j = 1}^\infty {(- 1)^{j - 1} e^{- 2j^2 \lambda ^2 } }$

$\lambda = [\sqrt {N_e } + 0.12 + {\frac{0.11} {\sqrt{N_e}}}] * D$

The $N_e$ is the effective number of data points

$N_e = {{N_1 N_2 }\over {N_1 + N_2}}$
